# x2 Calculators for the price of one!

This project (calculators.html) consists of two **HTML forms**.

1. First one computes any arithmetic expression entered.
Use operator "**" to exponentiate.

2. Second one takes two 24hr-format schedules (i.e.: 1430 & 1945) and computes the difference between them.
